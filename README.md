The python script for pybank is created to analyze the records to calculate the total number of months in the dataset, the net total of profit/loss over the entire period, the changes in profit/loss over the entire period, the average of the changes, greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period showing their date and amount.

The python script for pypoll is created to analyze the votes and calculate the total number of votes cast, list the candidates who received votes, calculate total number of votes and percentage for each candidate and display the winner based on popular vote.

For both pybank and pypoll I used the following sources to help write the script: google, bing, stackoverflow, w3schools.com, codecademy.com, docs.python.org, and BCS watching our cloud recordings and revisiting class activities on python.
